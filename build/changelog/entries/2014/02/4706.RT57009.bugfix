Copy text to Mozilla browser, mess up with the order
When copy to Mozilla it keeps the <br> tags instead of replacing them
for <p> tags. The solution is to replace the <br> tags by <p> tags but
only aiming <br> tags from the children of the parent. If the children of
the children have some <br> tags we assume that those were intentionally
written for a reason.
